              I took an internship at the City Government of Biñan, in Brgy. Zapote, Biñan, Laguna.
              The city government serves a crucial role in local governance, focusing on various public services and administrative functions.
              I was assigned to the Information & Communications Technology Office (ICTO) Department as a Software Developer Intern.

              I was assigned to the Information & Communications Technology Office (ICTO) Department as a Software Developer Intern, responsible for 
              collaborating with the Business Permits and Licensing Office (BPLO). The main objective was to develop a Document Management System 
              aimed at streamlining document handling processes, 
              enhancing operational efficiency, and improving service delivery within BPLO. 
              Throughout the practicum engagement, my responsibilities included full-stack web development, 
              version control management, user interface development, and back-end development to ensure the
              system's functionality met the department's requirements.

              I rendered a total of 368 hours to this practicum engagement, committed to delivering a scalable and 
              solution for the City Government of Biñan. My internship spanned from May 2, 2024, to July 12, 2024,
              during which I dedicated myself to the development of the Document Management System. Throughout this period, 
              I focused on various aspects of the project, including system architecture, database management, 
              front-end and back-end development, and ensuring the application met the specific needs of the Business Permits
              and Licensing Office (BPLO). Additionally, I collaborated closely with my team and supervisors, participated in 
              regular meetings, and continuously refined the system based on feedback and testing results.

              During my internship at the City Government of Biñan, I gained valuable hands-on experience
              in applying software development principles in a real-world setting. This experience taught 
              me the importance of being adaptable and continuously learning to tackle complex project challenges 
              effectively. It reinforced my dedication to excelling in software development and showed me how 
              technology can greatly enhance public service delivery.
